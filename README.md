# Emailer

## Summary
Python script that is able to send an email with attachments given a sender 
email, recipient email, and SMTP connection information. Allows the user to 
customize the email's body and subject.

_Note: If you have any questions or comments you can always use GitHub
discussions, or email me at farinaanthony96@gmail.com._

#### Why
Many scripts generate an output file. These output files usually are in the 
form of reports and need to go to a reporting email address or can be sent 
to someone's inbox to notify them.

## Requirements
- Python >= 3.9.2
- configparser >= 5.0.2

## Usage
- Enter the SMTP server information, the sender / recipient information, 
  and the email contents into the config.ini file.

- Simply run the script using Python:
  `python Emailer.py`

## Compatibility
Should be able to run on any machine with a Python interpreter. This script
was only tested on a Windows machine running Python 3.9.2.
